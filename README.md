# Self Care Center
## Introduction
- The purpose of this project was to allow students to practice some of the foundational concepts learned so far within the module. There are other extensions that test different skills that we can build on. The project allowed us to personalize/entertain different ideas with HTML/CSS as well as the functionality(JavaScript) behind the web page created.

## Technologies
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/self-care-center.html).

## Features
- Any of the radio buttons chosen will output a specific item from a Mantras or Affirmations Array
- The Choose Your Own Adventure I chose was the "Error Handling and Clear Button".  The Clear Message button will appear only when "Receive Message" is clicked and the meditation icon will also disappear.  Once the user selects Clear Message, the page will load back to the main form with the selection options.

## Possible Future Extensions
  - I would like to learn how to create a login page and create the functionality with it
